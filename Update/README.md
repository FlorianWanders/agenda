# Information about the updated agenda

The monthly overview is appended at the back. Chosing a transparent foil for the back cover at your (online) print showp will allow you to immediately see your appointments. 

### Summary of changes compared to the first agenda in the main forlder: 
* Appended the overview to the back instead of having it appear first in the agenda. Reversed the order and introduced blank pages so that past overview pages can be removed from the agenda. 
* Reduced the length of the weekly agenda from 1.5 years to 1 year (the updated agenda is about 1/3 lighter than before). 
* Fixed the font-size command for the overview (an incorrect command was ignored in the previous version) and reduced the font-size in the overview. 
* Added separate cell colors for Saturdays and Sundays (both colors are darker than the shared color for weekends in the original agenda, which was not very visible in a trial print).
