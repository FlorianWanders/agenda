# Information about the updated agenda

* The monthly overview is appended at the back. Chosing a transparent foil for the back cover at your (online) print shop will allow you to immediately see your appointments. 
* The date range for the monthly and the weekly agenda may now differ. Personally, I am using 2 years for the overview and 1 year for the weekly agenda. 

### Summary of changes compared to the first agenda in the main forlder: 
* Appended the overview to the back instead of having it appear first in the agenda. Reversed the order and introduced blank pages so that past overview pages can be removed from the agenda. 
* You can now choose as little/many overview pages as you like (an unneven number was required in the first agenda).
* Fixed the font-size command for the overview (an incorrect command was ignored in the previous version) and reduced the font-size in the overview. 
* Added separate cell colors for Saturdays and Sundays (both colors are darker than the shared color for weekends in the original agenda, which was not very visible in a trial print). 

# TODO

Use \Sexpr to define the name to be displayed on the agenda. Right now you have to edit the "Title page" section of the master file to change the name. Might do this sometime in the (far, far) future.
